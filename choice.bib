abstract = {In this paper we elicit preferences for money-time pairs via experimental techniques. We estimate a general specification of discounting that nests exponential and hyperbolic discounting, as well as various forms of present bias, including quasi-hyperbolic discounting.We find that discount rates are high and decline with both delay and amount, as most of the previous literature. We also find clear evidence for present bias. When identifying the form of the present bias, little evidence for quasi-hyperbolic discounting is found. The data strongly favor instead a specification with a small present bias in the form of a fixed cost, of the order of {\$}4 on average across subjects. With such a fixed cost the curvature of discounting is imprecisely estimated and both exponential and hyperbolic discounting cannot be rejected for several subjects. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Only recently have economists considered the behavioral and welfare implications of such time-inconsistent preferences. This paper outlines a simple formal model of self-control problems, applies this model to some specific economic applications, and discusses some general lessons and open questions in the economic analysis of immediate gratification. We emphasize the importance of the timing of the rewards and costs of an activity, as well as a person's awareness of future self-control problems. We identify situations where knowing about self-control problems helps a person and situations where it hurts her, and also identify situations where even mild self-control problems can severely damage a person. In the process, we describe specific implications of self-control problems for addiction, incentive theory, and consumer choice and marketing.},

@article{Sozou1998,
abstract = {The value of a future reward should be discounted where there is a risk that the reward will not be realized. If the risk manifests itself at a known, constant hazard rate, a risk-neutral recipient should discount the reward according to an exponential time-preference function. Experimental subjects, however, exhibit short-term time preferences that differ from the exponential in a manner consistent with a hazard rate that falls with increasing delay. It is shown here that this phenomenon can be explained by uncertainty in the underlying hazard. The time-preference function predicted by this analysis can be calculated by means of either (i) a direct superposition method, or (ii) Bayesian updating of the expected hazard rate. The observed hyperbolic time-preference function is consistent with an exponential prior distribution for the underlying hazard rate. Sensitivity of the predicted time-preference function to variation in the probability distribution of the underlying hazard rate is explored.},

@article{Wrede2011,
abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of hyperbolic discounting on the timing and on the number of births. Using a simple three-period model, it shows that, without the opportunity to shift the burden of rearing children into the future, hyperbolic discounters will give birth to fewer children. If childcare costs can be shifted completely to later periods, the impact of hyperbolic discounting on births depends on the underlying motive for motherhood, namely, whether children are regarded as consumption or investment goods. A large-sample empirical analysis, which uses an inconsistent savings pattern as an indicator of time inconsistency, confirms the theoretical results.},
